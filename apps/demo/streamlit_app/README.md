## FAQs

1. What is necessary to use `pyperclip` package on Streamlit Cloud?

   Streamlit Cloud runs linux while serving/hosting the apps. The python
   package [`pyperclip`](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/) uses
   apt-based package `xclip` as a dependency, installed on the app hosting
   OS.

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install xclip
   ```

   On Streamlit Cloud such `apt` based packages can be installed using an
   additional file `packages.txt` (alike `requirements.txt`).

1. Why is a `packages.txt` necessary for non-python dependencies?
